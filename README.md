## 📖 Description
BotInterface is a client application built with C++ and GTKmm 4 for managing Telegram bots. It includes:
1. Bot configuration.
2. Bot state management.
3. Bot statistics.

BotInterface built for https://github.com/cheat-r/adeqmeet/, but feel free to use it in your projects.

Full configuration for UI and backend is planned, but for now all entries and values hardcoded.

## ⚠️ Warning
BotInterface is in the early stages of development. Only a part of the UI is ready for the client, and the backend is not yet implemented; the server side is still in the conceptual phase.

## 🛠️ How It Works
Below is a rough outline of the workflow. Since the project is still under development, it may change.
